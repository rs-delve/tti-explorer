This is a repository for `tti-explorer`, a library for simulating infection spread. This library is built to explore the impact of various test-trace-isolate strategies and social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 in the UK.

Our model builds upon the model of [Kucharski et al. (2020)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.23.20077024v1). We use the BBC Pandemic dataset ([Klepac et al. (2018)](https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4647173/)).

This work was conducted for the Test, Trace, Isolate project as part of the Royal Society's DELVE initiative. This repository facilitiates simulations for a technical report which can be found [here](https://rs-delve.github.io/pdfs/2020-05-27-effectiveness-and-resource-requirements-of-tti-strategies.pdf). These simulations inform the report for the Test, Trace, Isolate project which can be found [here](https://rs-delve.github.io/reports/2020/05/27/test-trace-isolate.html). Exact version of this repo used in the report is available as a [tag](https://github.com/rs-delve/tti-explorer/releases/tag/rs-delve-tech-report-0520).
